I am currently a 1st year PhD student in the biostatistics department at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 

I graduated with a B.S. in math and statistics from the University of Chicago in 2016. I then worked for a year as a research assistant for [Professor G&uuml;nter Hitsch](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/h/gunter-j-hitsch) and [Professor Bradley Shapiro](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/s/bradley-shapiro) at the Booth School of Business before starting my program at Johns Hopkins.
