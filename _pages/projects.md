## past

* ***Advertising effects on consumer demand***: I worked with G&uuml;nter Hitsch and Bradley Shapiro at the Booth School of Business in 2016 - 2017 to investigate the effects of TV advertising on consumer purchases using regression discontinuities. I created a pipeline to clean and build the data for analysis. [[github]](https://github.com/albertkuo/Booth)

* ***Enhancer prediction and feature ranking of enhancer marks***: I was a participant in the 2015 DIMACS REU program at Rutgers University. I worked with Kevin Chen to analyze epigenetic data and predict enhancers using various statistical methods. [[DIMACS]](http://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/)[[pdf]][3]

The app was launched in 2016. [[Knowvio]](http://knowvio.org/)[[iOS app]](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/statistics-x-college-ap-stats/id1087170766?mt=8)
