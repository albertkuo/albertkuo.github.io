## current research

(work in progress)

## past research

***Advertising effects on consumer demand***: I worked on a project investigating the effects of TV advertising on consumer purchases using regression discontinuities with G&uuml;nter Hitsch and Bradley Shapiro at the Booth School of Business in 2016 - 2017. I created a pipeline to clean and build the data for analysis. [[github]](https://github.com/albertkuo/Booth)

***Enhancer prediction and feature ranking of enhancer marks***: I was a participant in the 2015 DIMACS REU program at Rutgers University. Under the mentorship of Kevin Chen, I analyzed epigenetic data and used various machine learning algorithms to predict enhancers. [[DIMACS]](http://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/)[[pdf]][3]

## just for fun 

***PUBG prediction model***: For a data science class project in 2018, I predicted players' finish placements in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), a battle royale video game. [[website]](https://pubg-prediction.github.io/project/)[[video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hp-gQzYe_w4)

***2018 Senate election predictions***: I used a Bayesian model to predict the Senate elections in 2018 and won a class competition. [[html]][7]

***Statistics X app***: I developed content, including video lectures and quizzes, for the Statistics X app with Knowvio, a mobile education startup founded by UChicago students. The app was launched in 2016. [[Knowvio]](http://knowvio.org/)[[iOS app]](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/statistics-x-college-ap-stats/id1087170766?mt=8)

***Predicting Kickstarter success***: For a natural language processing class project in 2016, I predicted Kickstarter campaign successes with convolutional neural networks. [[pdf]][6]

***Econometrics Game***: The econometrics game is a day-long competition held at UChicago where teams work on a data-driven research question. Finalists are chosen to present their findings to a panel of judges. Our team finished 2<sup>nd</sup> in both 2015 and 2016.

***Flappy Bird analysis***: In 2014, my friend Anthony and I collected Flappy Bird game scores and wrote up a report. [[pdf]][5]
