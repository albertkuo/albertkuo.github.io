Prior to joining the PhD program at Johns Hopkins, I did some research as an undergraduate student in quantitative marketing and computational biology.

* **-- Advertising Effects on Consumer Demand** / *2016 - 2017*
  * I worked on a project investigating the effects of TV advertising on consumer purchases using regression discontinuities with [G&uuml;nter Hitsch](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/h/gunter-j-hitsch) and [Bradley Shapiro](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/s/bradley-shapiro) at the Booth School of Business. I created a pipeline to clean and build the data for analysis. [[github]](https://github.com/albertkuo/ra_booth)

* **-- Enhancer Prediction and Feature Ranking** / *2015*
  * I was a participant in the 2015 DIMACS REU program at Rutgers University. Under the mentorship of [Kevin Chen](https://genfaculty.rutgers.edu/kcchen/home), I analyzed epigenetic data and used various machine learning algorithms to identify enhancers.
