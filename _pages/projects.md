## University of Chicago 

* **Advertising effects on consumer demand (2016-2017)**: I worked with Professor G&uuml;nter Hitsch and Professor Bradley Shapiro at the Booth School of Business, investigating the effects of TV advertising on consumer purchases in the United States. A sample of my R code is available on [github](https://github.com/albertkuo/Booth).
* **Statistics X app (2016)**: I created multimedia content for the iOS app Statistics X with [Knowvio](http://knowvio.org/), a mobile education startup founded by UChicago students. Check out the app [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/statistics-x-college-ap-stats/id1087170766?mt=8)! Knowvio has also released apps for learning [physics](http://knowvio.org/physics-x/), [chemistry](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chemistry-x-college-ap-chem/id1067707398?mt=8), [biology](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/biology-x-college-and-ap-bio/id1086398180?mt=8), [calculus](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calculus-x-college-ap-calc/id1029729565?mt=8), and [economics](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microeconomics-x-college-ap/id1097330096?mt=8). 
* **Predicting Kickstarter success with neural networks (2016)**: I took Natural Language Processing at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago and was mentored by Professor Kevin Gimpel for my [final project][6], where I predicted Kickstarter campaign success using convolutional neural networks. 
* **Oeconomica competition (2015, 2016)**: The [econometrics game](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/news/news/challenge-undergraduates-address-real-world-problems-econometrics) is a day-long competition where teams work on a data-driven research question. Finalists are chosen to present their findings to a panel of judges. My team finished 2nd in both 2015 and 2016. Here are our [2015][1] and [2016][2] papers.
* **Feature ranking of enhancer marks (2015)**: I was a participant in the [DIMACS REU](http://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/) program at Rutgers University. I worked with Professor Kevin Chen to analyze epigenetic data and predict enhancers using various statistical methods. Read my report [here][3].
* **Flappy Bird analysis (2014)**: My friend Anthony and I collected Flappy Bird game scores and wrote up a [statistical report][5] just for fun.
