**Booth Research Assistant (2016-2017)**: Post college, I worked for a year with Professor G&uuml;nter Hitsch and Professor Bradley Shapiro at the Booth School of Business. The project I was involved with investigated advertising effects on consumer purchases. A sample of my R code is available on [github](https://github.com/albertkuo/Booth).

**Natural Language Processing (2016)**: I took NLP at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago as a college senior. I was mentored by Professor Kevin Gimpel for my [final project][6], where I predicted Kickstarter campaign success using convolutional neural networks. 

**DIMACS REU (2015)**: I was a participant in the [DIMACS REU](http://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/) program at Rutgers University. I worked with Professor Kevin Chen to analyze epigenetic data and predict enhancers using various statistical methods. Read my paper [here][3].

**Oeconomica competition (2015, 2016)**: The [econometrics game](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/news/news/challenge-undergraduates-address-real-world-problems-econometrics) is a day-long competition where teams work on a data-driven research question and present their findings to a panel of judges. My team finished 2nd in both 2015 and 2016. Here are our [2015][1] and [2016][2] papers.

**Flappy Bird (2014)**: My friend Anthony and I collected Flappy Bird game scores and wrote up a [statistical report][5] just for fun.
