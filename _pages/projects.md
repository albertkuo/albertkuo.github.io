## past

* *Advertising effects on consumer demand* (2016-2017): I worked with Professor G&uuml;nter Hitsch and Professor Bradley Shapiro at the Booth School of Business and investigated the effects of TV advertising on consumer purchases using regression discontinuities. I created a pipeline to clean and build the data for analysis. [[github repo]](https://github.com/albertkuo/Booth)
* *Statistics X app* (2016): I developed content, including video lectures and quizzes, for the app Statistics X with Knowvio, a mobile education startup founded by UChicago students.[[Knowvio]](http://knowvio.org/)[[iOS app]](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/statistics-x-college-ap-stats/id1087170766?mt=8)
* *Predicting Kickstarter success with neural networks* (2016): I took Natural Language Processing with Professor Kevin Gimpel at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago. For my final project, I predicted Kickstarter campaign success using convolutional neural networks. [[report]][6]
* *Oeconomica competition* (2015, 2016): The econometrics game is a day-long competition where teams work on a data-driven research question. Finalists are chosen to present their findings to a panel of judges. Our team finished 2nd in both 2015 and 2016.

* *Feature ranking of enhancer marks* (2015): I was a participant in the DIMACS REU program at Rutgers University. I worked with Professor Kevin Chen to analyze epigenetic data and predict enhancers using various statistical methods. [[program desc]](http://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/)[[report]][3]
* *Flappy Bird analysis* (2014): My friend Anthony and I collected Flappy Bird game scores and wrote up a statistical report just for fun. [[report]][5]
