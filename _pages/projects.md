Prior to joining the PhD program at Johns Hopkins, I did some research as an undergraduate student in quantitative marketing and computational biology.

* **- Advertising Effects on Consumer Demand** (2016 - 2017)
  * I worked on a project investigating the effects of TV advertising on consumer purchases using regression discontinuities with [G&uuml;nter Hitsch](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/h/gunter-j-hitsch) and [Bradley Shapiro](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/s/bradley-shapiro) at the Booth School of Business. I created a pipeline to clean and build the data for analysis. [[github]](https://github.com/albertkuo/Booth)

* **- Enhancer Prediction and Feature Ranking of Enhancer Marks** (2015)
  * I was a participant in the 2015 DIMACS REU program at Rutgers University. Under the mentorship of [Kevin Chen](https://genfaculty.rutgers.edu/kcchen/home), I analyzed epigenetic data and used various machine learning algorithms to predict enhancers.

Below I've listed projects I worked on under less formal settings in classes, competitions, etc.

* **- PUBG Prediction Model** (2018)
  * For a data science class project, I predicted players' finish placements in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), a battle royale video game. [[website]](https://pubg-prediction.github.io/project/)[[video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hp-gQzYe_w4)

* **- 2018 Senate Election Predictions**
  * I used a Bayesian model to predict the Senate elections in 2018 and won a class competition. [[html]][7]
* **- Statistics X (iOS app)** (2016)
  * I developed content for the Statistics X app with Knowvio, a mobile education startup founded by UChicago students. The app was launched in 2016. [[Knowvio]](http://knowvio.org/)[[iOS app]](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/statistics-x-college-ap-stats/id1087170766?mt=8)
* **- Kickstarter Success Prediction** (2016)
  * For a natural language processing class project, I predicted Kickstarter campaign successes with convolutional neural networks. [[pdf]][6]
* **- Econometrics Game** (2015, 2016)
  * The econometrics game is a day-long competition held at UChicago where teams work on a data-driven research question. Finalists are chosen to present their findings to a panel of judges. Our team finished 2<sup>nd</sup> in both 2015 and 2016. [[Event]](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/news/news/challenge-undergraduates-address-real-world-problems-econometrics)[[2015 pdf]][1][[2016 pdf]][2]
* **- Flappy Bird Analysis** (2014) 
  * I collected Flappy Bird game scores and wrote up a report with my friend Anthony. [[pdf]][5]
