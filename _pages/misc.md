I keep a [reading blog](https://albertandkevin.wordpress.com/) with my friend Kevin. Three books I highly recommend are:

1. *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind* by Yuval Noah Harari
2. *The New Jim Crow* by Michelle Alexander
3. *A Little Life* by Hanya Yanagihara

Occasionally, I write (short) stories and (longer) works of fiction. I was a participant in [National Novel Writing Month](https://nanowrimo.org/) for three years, from 2014 to 2016. My most recent novel, *Watersilk*, is [available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Watersilk-Albert-Kuo/dp/1540777790). 

I am currently a member of the [Hopkins Concert Orchestra](https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/hso). I was previously a member of the [University Chamber Orchestra](https://music.uchicago.edu/page/instrumental-ensembles#University%20Chamber%20Orchestra) at the University of Chicago.

I watch a lot of tennis. [These](https://youtu.be/f8YEiCAPAbg) [are](https://youtu.be/zZO7saJQRxw) [some of](https://youtu.be/6c9OCIRUnHI) [my favorite](https://youtu.be/9gUvgm23qMU) [matches](https://youtu.be/bMR2UuLu_gs).
