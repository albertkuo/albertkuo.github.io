I keep a [reading blog](https://albertandkevin.wordpress.com/) with Kevin Sun. Two books I read recently that I highly recommend are *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind* by Yuval Noah Harari and *A Little Life* by Hanya Yanagihara. 

I occasionally write (short) stories and (longer) works of fiction. I was a participant in National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) for 3 years, from 2014 - 2016. You can find my most recent book [here](https://www.amazon.com/Watersilk-Albert-Kuo/dp/1540777790). 

In my remaining spare time, I make stop-motion animations, which you can watch on [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/albertkuo).
