**Writing** I occasionally write (short) stories and (longer) works of fiction. I was a participant in National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) for three years, from 2014 - 2016. In NaNoWriMo, participants are challenged to write a 50,000-word novel in the month of November. My most recent novel, *Watersilk*, is [available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Watersilk-Albert-Kuo/dp/1540777790). 

**Reading** I keep a [reading blog](https://albertandkevin.wordpress.com/) with my friend Kevin. Two books I highly recommend are *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind* by Yuval Noah Harari and *The New Jim Crow* by Michelle Alexander.

**Animation** In my remaining spare time, I make stop-motion animations, which you can watch on [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/albertkuo).
