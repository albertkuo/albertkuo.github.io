I am currently a violinist in the [Hopkins Concert Orchestra](https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/hso). I was previously a member of the [University Chamber Orchestra](https://music.uchicago.edu/page/instrumental-ensembles#University%20Chamber%20Orchestra) at the University of Chicago.

I occasionally write (short) stories and (longer) works of fiction. I was a participant in [National Novel Writing Month](https://nanowrimo.org/) for three years, from 2014 to 2016. My most recent novel, *Watersilk*, is [available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Watersilk-Albert-Kuo/dp/1540777790). 

I also keep a [reading blog](https://albertandkevin.wordpress.com/) with my friend Kevin. Three books I recommend are:

1. *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind* by Yuval Noah Harari
2. *The New Jim Crow* by Michelle Alexander
3. *A Little Life* by Hanya Yanagihara

I watch a lot of tennis. Just for kicks (and the remote possibility of inspiring someone to start watching tennis), here are some of my favorite tennis matches over the years:

1. [Federer - Nadal 2008 Wimbledon Final](https://youtu.be/f8YEiCAPAbg): Arguably the greatest match of all time.
2. [Federer - Nadal 2009 Australian Open Final](https://youtu.be/zZO7saJQRxw): High-level tennis in an emotional match.
3. [Radwanska - Kvitova 2015 WTA Finals](https://youtu.be/6c9OCIRUnHI): The magician at her best.
4. [Federer - Nadal 2017 Australian Open Final](https://youtu.be/9gUvgm23qMU): The history, the rivalry, the comeback!
5. [Hsieh - Kerber 2018 Australian Open 4R](https://youtu.be/bMR2UuLu_gs): Simply brilliant from Hsieh.
