I occasionally write (short) stories and (longer) works of fiction. I was a participant in National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) for the past 3 years, from 2014 - 2016. My most recent novel is available [here](https://www.amazon.com/Watersilk-Albert-Kuo/dp/1540777790). 

I also keep a [reading blog](https://albertandkevin.wordpress.com/) with Kevin Sun. Two books I read recently and recommend are *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind* by Yuval Noah Harari and *The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion* by Jonathan Haidt. 

In my remaining spare time, I make stop-motion animations, which you can watch on [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/albertkuo).
