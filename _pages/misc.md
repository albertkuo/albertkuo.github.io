***Writing***: I occasionally write (short) stories and (longer) works of fiction. I was a participant in National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) for three years, from 2014 to 2016. In NaNoWriMo, participants are challenged to write a 50,000-word novel in the month of November. My most recent novel, *Watersilk*, is [available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Watersilk-Albert-Kuo/dp/1540777790). 

***Reading***: I keep a [reading blog](https://albertandkevin.wordpress.com/) with my friend Kevin. Three books I recommend are *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind* by Yuval Noah Harari, *The New Jim Crow* by Michelle Alexander, and *A Little Life* by Hanya Yanagihara. 

***Music***: I am a violinist in the Hopkins Concert Orchestra. Check out our upcoming concerts [here](https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/hso/current-season/full-season/).
