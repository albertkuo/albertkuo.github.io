I am a 5th year biostatistics PhD student at Johns Hopkins University working with [Cristian Tomasetti](https://www.cristiantomasetti.com/) and 
[Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/) to develop statistical methods in
the fields of cancer and genomics. Previously, I interned at Amazon as a data scientist
in 2021 and received my bachelor's in mathematics and statistics from the University of Chicago in 2016.

In my free time, I enjoy writing on my [blog](https://blog.albertkuo.me/), reading, and playing music.
