I am a 5th year biostatistics PhD student at Johns Hopkins University working with [Cristian Tomasetti](https://www.cristiantomasetti.com/) and 
[Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/) to develop statistical methods in
the fields of cancer and genomics. Previously, I interned at Amazon as a data scientist and received my bachelor's in mathematics and statistics from the University of Chicago.

For fun, I like to write on my blog, read, and play music[.](/now)
