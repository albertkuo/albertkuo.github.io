I am a 5th year biostatistics PhD student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/),
working with [Cristian Tomasetti](https://www.cristiantomasetti.com/) and 
[Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/) to develop statistical methods in
the fields of cancer and genomics. I previously received my bachelor's in
math and statistics from the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) in 2016.

In my free time, I enjoy writing on my [blog](https://blog.albertkuo.me/) and making music.
