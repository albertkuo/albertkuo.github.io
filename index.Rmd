I am a data scientist in the [SCOT](https://www.amazon.science/tag/supply-chain-optimization-technologies) team at Amazon. I received my PhD in biostatistics from Johns Hopkins University, where I worked on statistical/ML methods and models for cancer and genomics. Previously, I received my bachelor's in mathematics and statistics from the University of Chicago.

For fun, I like to write on my blog, read, and play music.
