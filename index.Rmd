I am an applied scientist at Amazon. Previously, I received my PhD in biostatistics from Johns Hopkins University, where I worked on developing statistical/ML methods for applications in cancer and genomics research. I received my bachelor's degree in mathematics and statistics from the University of Chicago.

For fun, I like to write on my [blog](https://blog.albertkuo.me/), read, and play music.
