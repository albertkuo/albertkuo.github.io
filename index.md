I am a 2nd year PhD student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/index.html) at Johns Hopkins University. I received my bachelor's in math and statistics from the University of Chicago. In my spare time, you are likely to find me reading, watching tennis, or sleeping.
