I am a 5th year biostatistics PhD candidate at Johns Hopkins University. I am advised by [Cristian Tomasetti](https://cristiantomasetti.com), working in the field of cancer genomics to develop methods for the early detection of cancer and to model carcinogenesis. I also work closely with [Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/) in statistical genomics, with a focus on single nucleus RNA sequencing data. Previously, I received my bachelor's in math and statistics from the University of Chicago. 

In my free time, I enjoy [blogging](https://blog.albertkuo.me) about statistics, computing, and PhD life, and playing music in the [Hopkins Orchestra](https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/hso) and the [Hopkins Bloombachs](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bloombachsathopkins).
