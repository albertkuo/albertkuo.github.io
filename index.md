I am a 2nd year PhD student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/index.html) at Johns Hopkins University. Currently, I am working on developing statistical methods to estimate the risk of cancer and other diseases as a research assistant for [Cristian Tomasetti](https://cristiantomasetti.com). 

I received my bachelor's in math and statistics from the University of Chicago in 2016. In my free time, you are likely to find me reading, gaming, or watching tennis.
