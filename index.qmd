I am an applied scientist at Amazon. Previously, I received my PhD in biostatistics from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), where I worked on developing statistical/ML methods for applications in cancer and genomics research. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in mathematics and statistics from the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en).

For fun, I like to write on my blog, read, and play music.
